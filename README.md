# Vision Representation Learning

## Overview
This project studies learning transferable visual representations using CNNs and reusing them for downstream generative tasks such as GANs and Diffusion Models.

## Structure
- Data curation and preprocessing
- CNN feature learning
- Representation reuse for generation
- Quantitative and qualitative evaluation

## How to Run
