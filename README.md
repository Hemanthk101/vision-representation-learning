# vision-representation-learning
Built an end-to-end computer vision pipeline that learns transferable visual features using CNNs and reuses them for downstream generative modeling (GANs and Diffusion Models). The project emphasizes dataset curation, representation learning, quantitative evaluation, and reproducible research-oriented experimentation.
